Question 1: What is the role of middleware in a distributed system?
Create an abstract level to interact with customer
Hide detail of the operating services

Question 2: Explain what is meant by (distribution) transparency, 
and give examples of different types of transparency.
Distribution transparency is some features are hidden from the users. 
The end users are not aware of some mechanism under the distributed system.
It give the idea users using distributed system as a single system.
Types of transparency:
- Access transparency: user accessing remote and local resource with the same
operation.
- Location transparency: user accessing distributed resources without knowing 
where the resource located.
- Concurency transparency: many users active at the same time can access same
resoures without knowing accesses of others.
- Replication transparency: Resource is replicated but the user just know 
it as single
- Failure transparency: The fault and error are hidden from user and the other
parts of the system work normally.
- Scaling transparency: The system is scaling without affect the application 
working 

Question 3: Why is it sometimes so hard to hide the occurrence and recovery 
from failures in a distributed system?
The system is distributed so monitoring the operation of a node is hard and 
it's not easy to detect whether this node is just slow in response or stop.

Question 4: Why is it not always a good idea to aim at implementing the highest 
degree of transparency possible?
Highest degre of transparency might lead to difficult to find a way of backup.
For example of highest degree of location transparency, user see the system is located
at a single place, so they can not switch to other location if the server of
their location is down.

Question 5: What is an open distributed system and what benefits does openness provide?
An open distributed system is distributed system that easily to add, replace and integrate
new components. The ability to expand of open distributed system allowed its sharability.
Benefits:
- The ability to expand horizontally and vertically with software and hardware
- The sharability of resources because new clients could be added to the system
- Improve performance because of managing requests from clients
- Reliability

Question 6: Describe precisely what is meant by a scalable system.
Scalable system is the system that can be grow vertically or horizontally of both
hardware and software without losing the performance of the application

Question 7: Scalability can be achieved by applying different techniques. What are these techniques?
- Increase number of nodes
- Increase the size of each nodes
- Shared nothing technique: all nodes are equal, no master node, reduce failure
- Distributed shared memory: all nodes share the same memory
- Distributed storage system: separating between data storage and computing services.
- Parallel processing: divide the work to run together
- Asynchronous communication: don't have to wait for response
